    The [Entropy Data](https://www.entropy-data.com) API allows you to integrate with your data platform.
    
    You can manage data products, data usage agreements, data contracts, and teams. You can also approve, reject, or cancel data usage agreements. 
    
    You can observe any changes to data products, data usage agreements, data contracts, and teams via events by polling an [HTTP Feed](https://www.http-feeds.org/). 
    
    You need an API key for every operation. You can generate the API key within the UI in the organization settings.

    description: Data Products implement Data Contracts. They provide the actual data via output ports, and link to source systems via input ports.
  - name: Data Contracts
    description: Data Contracts are the API for Data. An output port can implement a data contract. A data contract can be implemented by multiple output ports. Entropy Data supports the Data Contract Specification and the Open Data Contract Standard (https://bitol-io.github.io/open-data-contract-standard). In this API docs, the Data Contract Specification is used.

  - name: Access
    description: Access (formerly known as "Data Usage Agreements") represents the edges in the graph. They connect a consuming data product with an output port of a providing data product. When active, the consumer should be able to access the data.
  - name: Source Systems
    description: Source Systems are the systems that provide data to the data products. They are connected to the data products via input ports.
  - name: Teams
    description: Teams are the organizational unit in the Entropy Data. They own data products, source systems, data contracts, and definitions.
  - name: Notification Channels
    description: Team-scoped notification channels for receiving alerts about data platform events. Each team can configure channels for different event types.
  - name: Definitions
    description: Definitions specify a reusable business or technical term, including its type, description, examples, and classifications. Definitions can be referenced from within Data Contracts.
  - name: Assets
    description: EXPERIMENTAL A data asset refers to any data-related resource or entity that can be managed and tracked within the system, such as a database table, file, or data pipeline.
  - name: Tags
    description: Tags can be applied to data products, data contracts or assets and are unique.
  - name: Policies
    description: EXPERIMENTAL Manage the policies of your data mesh. Policies are the rules of play of the data mesh.
  - name: Costs
    description: EXPERIMENTAL Expenses of data products, e.g., storage, compute, maintenance, and data transfer costs. The expenses can be automatically extracted from cloud provider billing APIs via our integrations.
  - name: Usage
    description: EXPERIMENTAL Usage information data product usage and query activity. Submit traces via OpenTelemetry/JSON format to monitor queries, consumers, and access patterns.
  - name: SCIM
    description: System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) endpoints for user and group provisioning and management.
  - name: Connectors
    description: EXPERIMENTAL Used by SDK and connectors. Use this API to store state (such as the lastEventId) and update health information.
  - name: Test Results
    description: EXPERIMENTAL Results of test runs of a data contract against a server (e.g., output port of a data product). The test runs van be executed using the Data Contract CLI tool.
  - name: Events
    description: Events are emitted when one of the core resource are created, updated, or deleted. There may be additional events like special state changes, as well.

            DISCOVER is an explorative mode that uses hybrid search as well as LLM reasoning to answer a user query.
            FIND is a filtered search that can retrieve resources by id, title, ownership or an expanding set of search criteria.
            GET_HELP is an assistant mode that also uses LLM interaction to explain business context, application usage and workflows to the user, based on Business Definitions and (in the future) online documentation.
